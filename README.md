## To complete this optional assignment, please complete all of the following requirements:

* [x] Create an HTML page with a header and body section that includes a form.
* [x] The form should have at least 5 input fields and one button (not an input type submit button - since we have no server to submit to).
* [x] At least one of these input fields should be validated using JavaScript on an onblur event.

 ## Notes

This is not supposed to be serious. At all.
